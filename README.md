# Algorithm Challenge #46 – Custom Absolute Value Function (Without Built-in abs)

🧮 Problem Description  
-
This program reads a floating-point number from the user and calculates its absolute value  
without using the built-in `abs()` function in C++.

The absolute value represents the positive version of a number:
- If the number is already positive, it remains unchanged.
- If the number is negative, it is converted to positive by multiplying it by -1.

Example:  
Input: -5  
Output: 5  

This challenge focuses on conditional logic and mathematical reasoning.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Understanding absolute value mathematically
- Using conditional statements (if / else)
- Writing reusable and clean functions in C++
- Comparing custom logic with built-in functions
- Strengthening problem-solving and algorithmic thinking

🧩 Example
-
**Input:**  
Enter a Number  
-7.5  

**Output:**  
My Absolute is 7.5  
C++ Absolute is 7.5
